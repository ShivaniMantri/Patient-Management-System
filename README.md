# Patient-Management-System

This Project follows a Microservices architecture. 

It is built using Java Spring Boot for developing modular backend services, with gRPC enabling efficient, low-latency inter-service communication. Apache Kafka is used as the event-streaming backbone for asynchronous messaging between services. An API Gateway sits at the edge of the system to route requests, handle authentication, and provide a unified entry point for clients. The application is deployed on AWS.
